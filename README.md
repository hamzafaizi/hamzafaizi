## Why I am learning to code? :laptop: :coding:

I want to learn coding because I want to become a great data scientist and use my skills to make great impact on the world.
By learning to code I will be able to solve complex problems, analyze data, and create solutions that will improve people's lives. I am eager to use technology to address issues like education inequality and access to information. learning to code will not only help me build a career but will also equip me with tools to create opportunities for others.

 ## My Goal :goal:

One of my goals is to create a free online resources and courses for people in Afghanistan and other underprivileged regions who don't have the means to attend universities and can not afford paid certifications. Through coding and data science, I aim to:

- Develop a platform that provide free, high-quality educational content.
- Make courses available in local languages to ensure accessibility for all.
- Expand these resources to benefit people worldwide, especially those who are financially disadvantaged or live in areas with limited educational opportunities
  
This is not just a personal ambition but a mission to empower individuals and help them unlock their potential through education and technology.
